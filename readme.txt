or visit <http://www.iammp.org/designfiles.php> where there is an overview
of the scanner hardware and data sheets
mechanical drawings of the scanner are the zip archive
<http://www.iammp.org/design/files/ChaseTransportDocs.zip>

The schematics in this folder are in expressPCB format
Eventually these will be converted to KICAD

This is the client driver.  It uses USB CDC to open a pipe
to the scanner.
